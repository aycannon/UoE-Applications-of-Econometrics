# UoE-Applications-of-Econometrics
Applications of Econometrics is a compulsory course at the University of Edinburgh. My notes compile the lecture slides and textbook. Everything to teach yourself the whole course is here. I have intentionally ignored most of the material on Tobit Models. This is purely because I do not think they will be examined thoroughly. 


For those who do not know how to compile TeX files:
- Download the zip file in the "code" dropdown (this should give you three files: main.tex, preamble.tex, folder of photos)
- all of these files are important
- go to overleaf (or other LaTeX compiler) and add all of these files to a project
- everything should work
